        <h2>Pinkosensitivism as Neologism</h2>
        <p>With so far almost 4k individual posts, the question that poses itself is – What makes an –ism? In this project, the author as an individual ceases to exist, and #pinkosensitivism has a life on its own which keeps changing. Now, more and more, there are collaborations, and clusters where sometimes people work together on larger art projects within the #pinkosensitivism.</p>
