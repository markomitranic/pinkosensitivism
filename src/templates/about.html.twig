        <h2>Pinkosensitivism as Neologism</h2>
        <p>Pinkosensitivism is a new word coined especially for an user affected by the color pink, and is meaningless otherwise. It's a combination of two existing words pink, sensitive and a suffix -ism which in general describes the audience and the goal of the project. </p>
