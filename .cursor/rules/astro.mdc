- Create .astro files for Astro components.
- If needed, use framework-specific components (Solid, React) for client interactivity.
- Leverage Astro's built-in components like <Image> when appropriate.
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette as defined in src/styles/global.css
- Minimize use of client-side components.
- Use the client:* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
  - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
  - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
  - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
  - client:only for components that should only be rendered on the client
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features. Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
