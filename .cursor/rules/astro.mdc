      When developing with Astro.js:

      1. Client-Side Hydration:
         - Minimize client-side components
         - Use appropriate client:* directives:
           - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
           - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
           - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
           - client:only for components that should only be rendered on the client
