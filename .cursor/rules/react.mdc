# Rules for working with React components

This is an Astro project, so react components can be used as either client, server or both render modes.

<rule>
name: client_data_fetching
description: Standards for data fetching and state management in browser code
actions:
  - type: suggest
    message: |
      For data fetching and state management in the browser (client components):
      1. ALWAYS use React Query (TanStack Query) for:
         - Data fetching
         - Loading states
         - Error handling
         - Cache management
         - Mutations (create/update/delete)
</rule>

      For form management:
      1. ALWAYS use React Hook Form for:
         - Form state management
         - Validation
         - Error handling
      2. NEVER use useState for form fields
      3. Use shadcn/ui form components when available - they are pre-integrated with React Hook Form
