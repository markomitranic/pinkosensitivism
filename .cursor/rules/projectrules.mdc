      When developing components:

      1. Create .astro files for Astro components
      2. Only use React components when client interactivity is required
      3. Leverage built-in Astro components like <Image> for optimized performance

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Using React for static content
      <ReactComponent>
        <StaticContent />
      </ReactComponent>

      // Good: Using Astro for static content
      <StaticContent />
    output: "Following project component development standards"
